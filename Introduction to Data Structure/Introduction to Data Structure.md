# Introduction to Data Structure

## Arrays 101

Arrays are a simple data structure for storing lots of similar items. They exist in all programming languages, and are used as the basis for most other data structures. On their own, Arrays can be used to solve many interesting problems. Arrays come up very often in interview problems, and so being a guru with them is a must!

In this Explore Card, we'll introduce Arrays and solve some cool problems with them. This Card is beginner friendly, and we've provided lots of code snippets in Java to help you understand. Each topic begins with informative articles, followed by real interview problems for you to practice on.

In addition, the problems have hints which will help you in building up ideas on how to solve them. These hints will be subtle enough to set you on a particular path for reaching the optimized solution, without giving away the answer too easily.

After completing this Explore Card on Arrays, you will understand:

* What an Array is.
* Basic properties of Arrays.
* Implementing basic Array operations.
* Simple programming techniques with Arrays.

### Array - A DVD box?

Suppose you had a bunch of DVDs at home that you wanted to arrange neatly. What would be the ideal choice for storing such a thing? You could find a cardboard box (or some other box) big enough to arrange all of the DVDs neatly, right? It's as simple as that. However, you might want to add a new DVD to the box, or you might want to get rid of the old ones that you've watched a million times over in the past. An important consideration for this box would be that you would only place DVDs in it and nothing else; you wouldn't place your clothes in it, for example. The box would contain multiple items, but all of them would be of the same type. In this case, that type is DVD. Items of the same type share properties. For DVDs, those properties include:

* All the DVDs would be inside a plastic cover.
* The cover would have the name of the movie, the cast, and all sorts of other details.
* All the covers would be of exactly the same size and would contain just one, and only one, DVD.
